# Web Development Practice Folder

This folder contains files and scripts for practicing and improving web development skills. Below is an overview of the contents and their purposes.

## Files Included

### 1. `index.html`

- **Purpose**: Serves as the main HTML document for practicing DOM manipulation and structuring web pages.
